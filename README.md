## Introduction

\_api is an autogenerated CRUD API built on [LowDB](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) and [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/). All you need to do is edit a configuration file and you will have a basic CRUD API ready to use!

### Foreword

\_api came about due to sheer curiosity. It's important to understand however, \_api was not built for large-scale applications, it's underlying database layer [LowDB](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) is built on pure JSON objects for storage and [Lodash](https://lodash.com) for parsing. This doesn't mean that \_api isn't worth your time, the biggest positive that I see with \_api is the sheer simplicity of both the concept and the code written thereby simplifying development and maintenance.

### Features

- Automatic CRUD API generation through the editing of config files (Theres only 3 files).
- Comprehensive CRUD operations.
  - Find endpoint supports data operators such as — filter, sort, and slice.
  - Update and remove endpoints support find by id as well as filter.
  - Update and remove endpoints support modifying multiple documents through the filter function.
  - Create endpoint supports automatic schema validation when schema is defined.
- Supports middleware functions for lodash chaining via mixins.
- By design each collection is saved in it's own JSON file thereby minimizing file size when writing to disk.

### Just don't do it

As great as I think \_api is, there are a few things I'm going to mention... and it's touched on in the foreword but I'll reiterate:

- **Don't use this for large-scale applications.** It's storing data in memory in JSON format. As fast as NodeJS is at reading/writing/parsing JSON, it's just not made out for it. Use a full-blown database like MongoDB or MariaDB. There's a great auto-api project called [Strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) that will suit those needs just fine!
- Don't store Base64 media in the database. It's going to cause bloat and slow down \_api. If you need to store images, store them elsewhere and link to them in the database.
- If you need high concurrent access to the \_api, this isn't for you. In fact NodeJS is probably not for you — look elsewhere.
- You can throw more hardware (CPU and RAM) at \_api but remember; cost to performance. LowDB doesn't scale very well if at all. I've sharded the database into separate JSON objects for each collection so it's as scaled as it can be within reason (and simplicity of code) I might in future explore further methods to enable clustering and PM2 integration but for now it's good enough.

**Now just to iterate the fact once more** — I did a quick (basic) load test with the default setup on a **[DigitalOcean $5.00 droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing)** using [loader.io](https://loader.io). The results pretty much show that while it's entirely possible to run 250 - 500 sustained concurrent requests creating thousands upon thousands of validated documents in the collection for a 5 minute duration, it's not the smartest thing to do given that the response time (round trip) average was hitting 1000 - 1500ms.

Having said that, \_api can happily handle 50 sustained concurrent users creating validated documents on the **[DigitalOcean $5.00 droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing)** with a response time (round trip) average of 250ms. On top of this during this load test, PM2 Monitor was showing the event loop cycle happily sitting at ~0.7ms and all responses taking anywhere between 6-25ms. So if you really want to handle larger request loads — just throw more money at it and ramp up the CPU + RAM numbers.

#### Known Test Result

- **Server:** DigitalOcean $5.00 Droplet — 1 Virtual CPU — 512MB RAM - 25GB Storage — Singapore.
- **Loader:** Loader.io — 50 Concurrent Users Per Second — 5 Minute Duration - Unknown Location (Probably the US).
- **Endpoint:** /users/create - schema validated — Dynamic JSON payload that generated a firstName, lastName key:value pair from 0 - 9223372036854775807.
- **Round Time:** ~250ms average.
- **Error Rate:** 0%.
- **Server Response Time:** ~6-25ms average.
- **NodeJS Event Loop Cycle:** ~0.7ms average.

- Implement \_gte, \_gt, \_lte, and \_lt comparators to the API for find, update, and remove endpoints.
- ~~Implement schema validation for creates.~~
- Implement schema validation for updates.
- Implement GraphQL.
- Implement an admin interface.

## Getting started

Download or clone this repository and then:

1. Enter the root directory of \_api.

```bash
cd _api/
```

2. Install the required node modules:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Open up `src/config/db/index.js` in your favorite text editor and start editing:

```js
SECRET: 'MY_SUPER_SECRET_KEY',
```

The `SECRET` property is your super secret key for encrypting and decrypting your collection files. Make this super private and hard to guess! By default, this API encrypts and decrypts the collection files, you can disable this by making it an empty string.

4. Open up `src/config/db/schema.js` to then add collections and schemas.

`CollectionsSchema` is where the magic happens — this property is what generates the different collections that make up your database which in turn make up the CRUD API. If you want to add more collections, just add an object into the `CollectionsSchema` array like so:

```js
export const CollectionsSchema = [
  {
    users: [],
  },
];
```

5. This step is optional, but if you would like to have schema validation for when you create new documents in your collections, you can also edit `DocumentsSchema` within the `src/config/db/schema.js` file. For more information on the schema format — go to [Nijikokun/Validator](https://github.com/Nijikokun/Validator) GitHub repository. **Currently, schema validation only works for creating documents**. If you don't define a schema, then the create endpoint will just insert the document.

**One really important note for when it comes to defining a schema, your document schema name must match the name of the collection!** For example, if your collection name is `users`, your document schema name **MUST** be `users`.

```js
export const DocumentsSchema = {
  users: {
    firstName: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    lastName: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
  },
};
```

_You can delete the users collection, it's there as an example._

6. Now you can start the API.

```bash
npm run start
```

or if you prefer to develop with Nodemon;

```bash
npm run watch
```

## API

\_api is great in that it will automatically generate all the CRUD routes with the data operation functions for you. Below are the auto-generated routes.

### Endpoints

#### Find

Before we go onto the routes, the `find` endpoints are really awesome! They can accept data operators such as filter, sort, and slice. What is even better is that you can chain them! But there is one really important thing to remember before you go chaining your URL queries — the order of operations — the data operators iteration order is non-guarantee as its being called from `_.forEach()` (Lodash).

Find all:

Returns all documents in a collection.

```url
hostname:port/your_collection/
```

Find by id:

You can search for a document in a collection by id. It will only return one document.

```url
hostname:port/your_collection?_id=123
```

Find by filter:

Filter only accepts JSON objects. This means when you pass it into the URL parameters, you will need to convert to a valid JSON string which will need to be converted to % notation — JSON.stringify() does this for you.

```url
hostname:port/your_collection?_filter={"key":"value"}
```

Find by sort and order:

You can sort results by key, by default the order sent back is ascending but by specifying a `_order` parameter you can have descending order. `_order` takes only two values — `asc` and `desc`.

```url
hostname:port/your_collection?_sort=key&_order=desc
```

Find by slice:

You can slice your results by specifying a start index and an end index. Either is optional and will default to `start = 0` and `end = collection.size()`. If you are slicing, an additional header property `X-Total-Count` will be returned which will hold the total documents in the collection.

```url
hostname:port/your_collection?_start=10&_end=20
```

#### Create

Create one:

You will need to pass the document values in JSON object defined in your request body. Don't worry about passing an id value as \_api will automatically generate an id for you. The response will be the document created including the unique id for it.

Also to note, you can define a JSON schema for the document in the config file `src/config/db/schema.js`. For more information on how the format of the schema should be — go to [Nijikokun/Validator](https://github.com/Nijikokun/Validator) GitHub repository. **Currently, schema validation only works for creating documents**. If you do not provide a schema, the create endpoint will just create a document in the collection without validation.

```url
hostname:port/your_collection/create
```

#### Update

Update by id:

You can update a document in the collection by id. The new values are to be passed in by JSON object via the request body. The response will be the document updated.

```url
hostname:port/your_collection/update?_id=123
```

Update by filter:

You can update one or more by filter. Filter only accepts JSON objects. This means when you pass it into the URL parameters, you will need to convert to a valid JSON string which will need to be converted to % notation — JSON.stringify() does this for you. The response will be the document or documents updated.

```url
hostname:port/your_collection/update?_filter={"key":"value"}
```

#### Remove

Remove by id:

You can remove a document in the collection by id. The response will be the document removed.

```url
hostname:port/your_collection/remove?_id=123
```

Remove by filter:

You can remove one or more by filter. Filter only accepts JSON objects. This means when you pass it into the URL parameters, you will need to convert to a valid JSON string which will need to be converted to % notation — JSON.stringify() does this for you. The response will be the document or documents removed.

```url
hostname:port/your_collection/remove?_filter={"key":"value"}
```

## Server configuration

### Name

Go to `src/config/server/index.js` and just set a name, any name. `NAME`'s default is `_api`.

### Port

To change the port that \_api is listening to, head over to `src/config/server/index.js` and change the property `PORT` to a port of your desire (must be a number).

### Morgan

[Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) is an ExpressJS middleware that does one thing and one thing only — logs requests. You can configure Morgan in `src/config/server/index.js`, the current configuration parameter only allows for format to be defined. You can change this by modifying the middleware load code in `src/index.js`.

### Request rate limit

By default, the server is setup to rate limit all request to all endpoints from the same IP if they hit 100 requests in a minute. You can configure this in the server configuration file `src/config/server/index.js` and alter the properties `windowMs` and `max` under `RATE_LIMIT` object to your content. This functionality is implemented using [express-rate-limit](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit).

### Loader.io

By default, \_api supports load testing from [loader.io](https://loader.io/). There is a predefined route available for [loader.io](https://loader.io/) to validate against. To set this up, head to the `src/config/server/index.js` file and edit the `LOADER` property. You just need to supply the string [loader.io](https://loader.io/) provides as the value for the property.

## Lodash chain middleware

If you need to define middleware functions, you can do that easily through the middleware file: `src/middleware/index.js`. All you need to do is define your functions in here and they will be loaded to each collection automatically as lodash mixins (So you can chain them with other middleware or lodash functions). An example:

```js
// Create and export an object to hold middleware function declarations.
const Middleware = {
  helloWorld: () => {
    return 'Hello World!';
  },
};

export default Middleware;
```

To use this, you would then need to modify the API routes in the `src/router/index.js` file.

On-top of these chained middleware functions, you can also utilize any ExpressJS middleware as you normally would. Just make sure you define it before the collection/database generation logic.

## Helper functions

The helpers file: `src/helpers/index.js` contain all your reusable functions. Just import this file anywhere you need it and you will have access to the functions defined and exported in there. Currently there are a few helper functions already defined — those are:

### isJSONString()

Checks to see if a string is a valid JSON String which can be parsed into a JSON object. Returns either `true` or `false`.

```js
isJSONString((string: String));
```

### getTotalCollections()

Returns the total number of collections in an object. See `src/config/db` and the `DB_CONFIG.COLLECTION` object for more details as to what the object should look like in terms of structure.

```js
getTotalCollections((collection: Object));
```

### responseBuilder()

This function takes in a HTTP status code, request header, data object, and a message object to then return a JSON object for the response body. If the data object provided is empty, this will return a `404 not found` response body regardless of what the code input was.

```js
responseBuilder((code: Number), (request: Object), (data: Object), (message: Object));
```

### requestQueryHandler()

The magic function that parses through the `request.query` object to fetch and filter, sort, and slice data. This function will return an object with 2 objects within. The structure is:

```js
{
  header: {
    ...
  },
  data: {
    ...
  }
}
```

The router will have the logic to handle this for you but if you are modifying the router — keep this in mind.

```js
requestQueryHandler((request: Object), (collection: Object), (collectionKey: String));
```

### validateSchema()

Barebones JSON validator. Accepts two JSON objects; first one is the incoming object to be validated, second one is the JSON schema object used to validate (For more information on the format of the JSON scheme — go to [Nijikokun/Validator](https://github.com/Nijikokun/Validator) GitHub repository). Return true if it is valid, false if it is not.

```js
validateSchema((object: Object), (schema: Object));
```
